    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My friend and colleague at Fluidinfo,
<a href="https://twitter.com/ceronman">Manuel Cerón</a>, gave me this script that
he wrote to remove merged branches from local and remote Git
repositories.  Removing branches after merging is one of those fairly
painless housekeeping tasks that doesn&#8217;t create a great deal of
friction, which makes it easy to avoid automating, but it wastes a lot
of time as days and weeks go by.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s available in this <a href="https://gist.github.com/3139743">gist</a>.  You
can wire it up as a <code>cleanbranches</code> command by adding the following to
your <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nv">cleanbranches</span> <span class="o">=</span> !/home/jkakar/bin/gitcleanbranches.sh
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now you can run <code>git cleanbranches</code> in any repository and local and
remote branches that have already been merged will be deleted
automatically.  It&#8217;s a simple thing, but one of those simple things
that makes a nice difference in the daily workflow.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a long while since I posted and a lot has happened!  A litte
more than a year ago I left <a href="http://canonical.com">Canonical</a> and
joined <a href="http://fluidinfo.com/">Fluidinfo</a>.  Fluidinfo is a shared
openly-writable metadata storage platform, often referred to as a
social network for data.  There&#8217;s a lot to say about Fluidinfo, much
of which is already discussed on the
<a href="http://blogs.fluidinfo.com/fluidinfo/">Fluidinfo blog</a>, and I plan to
write more about it in the future.  When I first got involved with
Fluidinfo I made a concept map to better understand the data model.
I&#8217;ve been meaning to publish it for ages, so here it is.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year I was working with Canonical&#8217;s design team.  We were
putting our heads together to develop a fantastic cloud user
experience in Landscape.  I created a concept map to help clarify the
various artefacts involved in the

It&#8217;s not entirely complete, but it does capture the most important
aspects of the model.  I find it useful as a high-level diagram,
hopefully you will too.</p>

    <updated>2010-10-03T12:25:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kakar.ca/blog/2010/10/03/beautiful-emacs-configuration</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> I&#8217;ve moved my emacs configuration to
<a href="https://github.com/jkakar/emacs-configuration">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Some time ago during a sprint, I noticed that
<a href="https://launchpad.net/~free.ekanayaka">Free Ekanayaka</a>, one of my
Landscape teammates, had excellent pyflakes/flymake integration that
dramatically improved the experience of editing Python files in emacs.
When I asked him about it he kindly offered to share his configuration
and I was excited to pick out the flymake settings he had.  When I
actually looked at what he&#8217;d sent me I was blown away.  He has the
most elegant emacs configuration I&#8217;ve ever seen.  He uses a simple
pattern composed of individual configuration files, each focused on a
particular set of customizations such as appearance, interaction,
programming, etc. that are all wired up to create the final result.
It&#8217;s very clean and avoids the blob-of-crap problem that most emacs
configuration suffers from.</p>

<p>This evening I finally took his ideas and refactored them to match my
emacs setup.  The structure is the same, but the details are, in some
cases, quite different.  I&#8217;m managing the configuration with Bazaar
and have pushed it to Launchpad at
<a href="https://code.edge.launchpad.net/~jkakar/+junk/emacs">lp:~jkakar/+junk/emacs</a>.
Hopefully others will find this as inspiring as I have.</p>

    <updated>2010-09-27T12:25:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kakar.ca/blog/2010/09/27/my-work-at-canonical</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A number of folks at <a href="http://www.canonical.com/">Canonical</a> have been
writing about what we do and how our work contributes to the goal of
getting free software into the mainstream.  Canonical and
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> have brought free software to the
general public in a way that hasn&#8217;t been done before, in a very short
span of time.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been working on the Landscape Team since early 2006.  I was one
of the founding members of the project along with
<a href="http://blog.labix.org/">Gustavo</a> and
<a href="http://radix.twistedmatrix.com/">Chris</a>.
<a href="http://www.canonical.com/enterprise-services/ubuntu-advantage/landscape">Landscape</a>
is a web-based tool that eases the task of managing large deployments
of Ubuntu.  It is one of the many services that Canonical provides, as
a value add to Ubuntu, and is proprietary software.  At this point
you&#8217;re probably thinking, &#8220;How can proprietary software help the goal
of spreading free software?  That&#8217;s crazy talk.&#8221;  Well, in at least
two ways.</p>

<p>Landscape makes it possible for people that could never have chosen
Ubuntu to consider it, and in many cases to adopt it.  Our enterprise
customers look at Ubuntu and they like what it offers, but that&#8217;s only
the beginning of the story.  Management is a big concern for
organizations that roll out tens, hundreds or thousands of Ubuntu
machines.  Without a management solution, Ubuntu is a non-starter no
matter how good the user experience.</p>

<p>Landscape is a revenue generator for Canonical and, though we&#8217;d all
love to release it as free software, that revenue is very important.
It contributes to the sustainability of the company and thus, to the
sustainability of Ubuntu itself.  We do as much work as we can in the
open.  For example, <a href="https://storm.canonical.com/">Storm</a>, an object
relational mapper for Python, was developed by the Landscape Team and
released as free software.  We&#8217;ve sent patches to projects such as
<a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/">Twisted</a>,
<a href="https://launchpad.net/txaws">txAWS</a> and others.</p>

<p>Although my work may be controversial in the wider free software
community I&#8217;m a free software developer at heart.  The effort I put
into Landscape is good for free software in general.  It helps Ubuntu
gain adoption in places where it simply wouldn&#8217;t be considered without
a tool like Landscape.  Canonical has been, and continues to be, an
amazing place to work.  It is full of passionate people all doing
their part to get free software out into the world.</p>

    <id>http://kakar.ca/blog/2010/08/06/storm-0-dot-17-is-out-in-the-world</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I released version 0.17 of
<a href="http://storm.canonical.com/">Storm</a>.  This release fixes a
checkpointing bug that could cause coherency issues in certain
situations involving triggers.  It introduces a handful of new
features and optimizations including the ability to get a
<a href="http://people.canonical.com/~therve/storm/storm.expr.Select.html"><code>Select</code></a>
expression from a
<a href="http://people.canonical.com/~jkakar/storm/storm.store.ResultSet.html"><code>ResultSet</code></a>,
which is useful when building a query with a subselect.  It also
includes safety checks to ensure that a
<a href="http://people.canonical.com/~therve/storm/storm.store.Store.html"><code>Store</code></a>
is only used when database access is expected and only from the thread
in which it was created.  The
<a href="http://launchpad.net/storm/+milestone/0.17">release notes</a> have
detailed information about the changes along with links to the MD5 sum
and GPG signature for the
<a href="http://edge.launchpad.net/storm/trunk/0.17/+download/storm-0.17.tar.bz2">tarball</a>.
I&#8217;ve also built official packages for Ubuntu users, available in the
<a href="https://launchpad.net/~storm/+archive/ppa">Storm PPA</a>.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re always interested in hearing about your experiences with Storm.
If you have comments or questions please feel free to hop into
<code>#storm</code> on Freenode and talk to us, or post a message on the
<a href="https://lists.canonical.com/mailman/listinfo/storm">mailing list</a>.</p>

    <id>http://kakar.ca/blog/2010/07/05/discovering-the-ec2-api</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been using the EC2 API quite a lot lately, while working on the
<a href="https://landscape.canonical.com/">Landscape</a> project.  The
<a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/">API documentation</a>
is excellent, but I want to know how it behaves when things go wrong.
What kind of failure is produced when I forget to pass a parameter?
What happens when I pass a bogus parameter?  How does it behave when I
pass numbered parameters that aren&#8217;t in sequence, like
<code>Name.7=foo&amp;Name.42=bar</code>? How does Amazon&#8217;s implementation differ from
<a href="http://eucalyptus.com/">Eucalyptus</a> or <a href="http://novacc.org/">Nova</a>?</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t find the answers I wanted in the documentation so I wrote a
simple tool to invoke a method with an arbitrary set of parameters
against an EC2 API endpoint.  After sending the request, it prints the
HTTP status code and response to the screen.  It&#8217;s called
<code>txaws-discover</code> and is part of the
<a href="https://launchpad.net/txaws">txAWS</a> project.  For example, to run the
<code>DescribeRegions</code> method simply provide credentials, an endpoint, the
method name and whatever parameters you want to pass with it:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>txaws-discover --key NUJOZS2V6RWQUJ3G8JUT <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>    --secret +Ki9Wk5Y4kudFh1EcnB3hthC9PtVU+CcfMJZ4DVl <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>    --endpoint https://ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>    --action DescribeRegions <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>    --RegionName.0 us-west-1
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This command produces the following output:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/DescribeRegionsResponse&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The credentials and API endpoint can be defined in environment
variables to make <code>txaws-discover</code> easier to use:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</span><span class="o">=</span>NUJOZS2V6RWQUJ3G8JUT
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</span><span class="o">=</span>+Ki9Wk5Y4kudFh1EcnB3hthC9PtVU+CcfMJZ4DVl
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">AWS_ENDPOINT</span><span class="o">=</span>https://ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>With those defined, the command above can be shortened:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>txaws-discover --action DescribeRegions --RegionName.0 us-west-1
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It&#8217;s in <a href="https://code.launchpad.net/~txaws-dev/txaws/trunk">lp:txaws</a>
and has proven to be very helpful as a learning tool.</p>

    <link href="http://kakar.ca/blog/2010/06/13/object-collections-in-storm/"/>
    <updated>2010-06-13T12:25:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kakar.ca/blog/2010/06/13/object-collections-in-storm</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="https://storm.canonical.com/">Storm</a>, the
<a href="http://people.canonical.com/~therve/storm/storm.store.Store.html#find"><code>Store.find</code></a>
method runs a query and returns matching objects.  Finding all
accounts in the database, the equivalent of <code>SELECT * FROM account</code>,
is simple:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">store</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Account</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Clauses to limit the scope of the query can be passed to find.
Finding all accounts owned by Vince Offer, the equivalent of <code>SELECT *
FROM account WHERE owner = ‘Vince Offer'</code>, is also simple:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">store</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Account</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Account</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">owner</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">&quot;Vince Offer&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Another way to achieve the same thing is to take the result from the
first find operation and refine it:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="n">result1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">store</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Account</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">result2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">result1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Account</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">owner</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">&quot;Vince Offer&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Storm doesn&#8217;t run a query until you do something with the result, so
the impact on the database is exactly the same as in the previous
example.  This is the simplest form of what
<a href="http://code.mumak.net/">Jonathan</a> and I have been calling the
collection pattern.  The basic idea is that you start with a
collection of all objects, and then refine it, until you have the
collection you want.  This pattern is possible using pure Storm, as
shown above, but we&#8217;ve found it useful to implement objects that hide
this logic and provide a more user friendly API.  For example, an
<code>AccountCollection</code> would provide filtering logic as named methods:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Each filtering method, such as <code>owned_by</code> and <code>has_unpaid_invoices</code>
returns a new <code>AccountCollection</code> instance.  This isn&#8217;t strictly
necessary but creating a new instance is both easier to understand and
implement.  Finding all accounts owned by <code>Vince Offer</code> that have unpaid
invoices is quite easy:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="n">collection1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">AccountCollection</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">collection2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">collection1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">owned_by</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Vince Offer&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">collection3</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">collection2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">has_unpaid_invoices</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">collection3</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This pattern provides several benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It names filtering options which makes them easy to understand and
use.</p></li>
<li><p>Query building logic is in one place which eliminates duplication.</p></li>
<li><p>All the criteria used to build a query are available when the query
is generated, which makes it possible to generate optimized queries.
All users of the collection benefit from optimizations.</p></li>
<li><p>It creates a clean separation between finding data and using it.
This helps keep application logic more focused, because it isn&#8217;t
intermingled with the particulars of generating queries.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>We&#8217;ve used this pattern to good effect in both
<a href="https://landscape.canonical.com/">Landscape</a> and
<a href="https://launchpad.net/">Launchpad</a>.  In a future post I&#8217;ll talk about
some different strategies we&#8217;ve used to implement the pattern.</p>

    <updated>2010-06-12T12:25:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kakar.ca/blog/2010/06/12/introducing-commandant</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to write about
<a href="https://launchpad.net/commandant">Commandant</a> for ages.  I started it
last year because I wanted to write command driven applications with a
user experience just like <a href="http://bazaar.canonical.com/">Bazaar</a>.
There are several things that I like about Bazaar&#8217;s user interface:</p>

<ul>
<li>You only have to know that the program is called <code>bzr</code> to start
discovering it, because its default behaviour is to teach you how to
use the builtin help system.</li>
<li>Each command has a clear name that makes its purpose easy to discern.</li>
<li>Each command has a succinct summary and a well written long
description, along with clear information about the arguments and
options the command accepts.</li>
<li>Help topics provide general information about the program that isn&#8217;t
command-specific.  The topics describe conceptual and technical
aspects of the program that help the user better understand how to
use it.</li>
<li>The interface conventions are very simple.  It doesn&#8217;t take long to
figure out how things work.</li>
</ul>


<p>I wanted, as much as possible, to start writing application logic
without having to do much work to get a working user interface.  With
that in mind, the basic goal for Commandant is to provide a
Bazaar-like user interface with the least effort possible.  I started
by trying to extend Bazaar but I ran into tricky integration problems
that made it hard to make progress, so I switched gears and started
implementing the logic from scratch.  Reinventing the wheel got me
further than trying to integrate, but I quickly reached a point where
progress slowed down because I had to deal with tricky problems that
Bazaar had already solved.  In the meantime,
<a href="http://rbtcollins.wordpress.com/">Robert</a> landed changes in Bazaar
that removed the integration hurdles that I&#8217;d run into.</p>

<p>With the integration problems out of the way, I stopped wasting time
reinventing the wheel, and Commandant is now a thin layer on top of
<code>bzrlib</code> itself.  Being able to take advantage of the work that has
been done in Bazaar has been a blessing.  There&#8217;s more that can be done
to improve Commandant, but it is very usable in its current state.  If
you&#8217;re interested in learning more, the
<a href="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~jkakar/commandant/trunk/annotate/head:/README">README</a>
file should get you started.</p>

    <updated>2010-04-08T12:25:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kakar.ca/blog/2010/04/08/using-sql-functions-with-storm</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>People ask me questions about <a href="https://storm.canonical.com/">Storm</a>
several times a week, and I&#8217;m happy to help where I can, but it would
be better if the information our users need was easier to find.  Our
documentation story is weak and, as a result, Storm is harder to
discover than it ought to be.  If you do run into problems or have
questions, please hop into <code>#storm</code> on Freenode and we&#8217;ll do our best
to help you.  I want to improve the documentation situation, but
finding the time to do so hasn&#8217;t happened yet.  The next best thing is
to post some helpful hints here.</p>

<p>First, some advice: if you don&#8217;t know what SQL query you want to run,
using Storm will probably be hard.  When I get asked a question about
writing a query using Storm I almost always respond with, &#8220;What does
the query you want to run look like?&#8221; The querying part of Storm is
essentially just an expression compiler that takes a list of
expressions and converts them to SQL.  Once you know what end result
you want, working backwards to figure out the Storm parlance is
relatively straight forward.</p>

<p>Today I was asked about using
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_%28SQL%29#COALESCE"><code>COALESCE</code></a>.
The person asking the question found the
<a href="http://people.canonical.com/~therve/storm/storm.expr.Coalesce.html"><code>storm.expr.Coalesce</code></a>
expression but it wasn&#8217;t obvious how to use it.  He knew he wanted to
run a query like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sql'><span class='line'><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="k">table</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">COALESCE</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">col1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">col2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;foo&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>With that knowledge, figuring out how to use Storm was quite easy:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sql'><span class='line'><span class="n">store</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">Table</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Coalesce</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">Table</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">col1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">Table</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">col2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="ss">&quot;foo&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Furthermore, <code>Coalesce</code> is just a helper expression to aid usability
and readability.  If we didn&#8217;t have a built-in <code>Coalesce</code> expression
the query could have been written using the generic
<a href="http://people.canonical.com/~therve/storm/storm.expr.Func.html"><code>storm.expr.Func</code></a>
expression:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sql'><span class='line'><span class="n">store</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">Table</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Func</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">&quot;COALESCE&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">Table</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">col1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">Table</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">col2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="ss">&quot;foo&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you want to use a SQL function in a Storm query, and there is no
built-in expression for it, you can use <code>Func</code> to call it.</p>

    <link href="http://kakar.ca/blog/2009/12/02/talking-about-storm/"/>
    <updated>2009-12-02T12:14:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://kakar.ca/blog/2009/12/02/talking-about-storm</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I gave a talk about <a href="http://storm.canonical.com/">Storm</a> to the
fine folks that make up the local
<a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/VanPyZ">Python users group</a>. I think the
talk went alright.  It wasn&#8217;t awesome but I don&#8217;t think it was
terrible either.  It&#8217;s the third public talk I&#8217;ve given, pretty much
ever, and so I have a lot to learn about the process.  The group is
friendly and I felt comfortable standing up in front of everyone and
yammering on about Storm.</p>

<p>In retrospect, I should have come up with much better example code.  I
didn&#8217;t make enough time to prepare and, due to rushing at the end, the
topics I covered were rather basic.  I did an experiment and wrote a
psuedo-doctest to use as slides.  The doctest and a script to run it
are available at
<a href="https://code.launchpad.net/~jkakar/+junk/storm-talk">lp:~jkakar/+junk/storm-talk</a>.
I used a slightly hacked version of
<a href="https://launchpad.net/~mwhudson">Michael Hudson-Doyle&#8217;s</a> very awesome
<a href="http://launchpad.net/console-presenter">console-presenter</a>, which is
available at
<a href="https://code.launchpad.net/~jkakar/console-presenter/two-line-separator">lp:~jkakar/console-presenter/two-line-separator</a>.</p>

<p>The format was great for getting me to focus on content, even though I
didn&#8217;t have enough time to do a great job preparing it, but the slides
were a bit lackluster being grey text on a black background.  Also, a
common problem with doctests is that you need to keep track of the
state of the program as you read the document.  I think this problem
made the format awkward for the audience.  It was a good experiment,
but in the future I&#8217;ll use traditional slides, and try to avoid a
situation that requires the audience to keep program state in their
head as the talk progresses.  Funny how these things seem so obvious
in hindsight.</p>

<p><a href="http://douglatornell.ca/">Doug Latornell</a> gave a nice talk about his
experiences using <a href="http://pyyaml.org/">PyYAML</a>,
<a href="http://stuvel.eu/projects/flickrapi">flickerapi</a> and
<a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter">Tkinter</a> to build an application
that displays random photos on his living room TV, both from his
personal collection and from his favourite groups on Flickr.  I
enjoyed the talk and the discussion it spurred.</p>

<p>All in all it was a good experience and from which I&#8217;ve learnt some
lessons, which I can hopefully use to make the next talk better.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I released version 0.16 of
<a href="http://storm.canonical.com/">Storm</a>.  This release fixes some memory
leaks and introduces a handful of new features.  The number of changes
since 0.15 aren&#8217;t vast, but we&#8217;re trying to get into the habit of
releasing regularly, so hopefully this will become a trend. The
<a href="http://launchpad.net/storm/+milestone/0.16">release notes</a> have
detailed information about the changes along with links to the MD5 sum
and GPG signature for the
<a href="http://launchpad.net/storm/trunk/0.16/+download/storm-0.16.0.tar.bz2">tarball</a>.
I&#8217;ve also built official packages for Ubuntu users, available in the
<a href="https://launchpad.net/~storm/+archive/ppa">Storm PPA</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the <code>karmic</code> and <code>lucid</code> packages don&#8217;t work properly
because they install files in <code>/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages</code>,
which is no longer included in <code>sys.path</code> by default.  In the next
couple of days I&#8217;ll build new packages that correctly install files in
<code>/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages</code>, which should fix the problem.  For
now, adding the <code>site-packages</code> path to <code>sys.path</code> or including it in
<code>PYTHONPATH</code> will workaround the issue.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re always interested in hearing about your experiences with Storm.
If you have comments or questions please feel free to hop into
<code>#storm</code> on Freenode and chat us up, or post a message to the
<a href="https://lists.canonical.com/mailman/listinfo/storm">mailing list</a>.</p>
