Earlier this year I was working with Canonical's design team.  We were
putting our heads together to develop a fantastic cloud user
experience in Landscape.  I created a concept map to help clarify the
various artefacts involved in the
[EC2 API](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/).
It's not entirely complete, but it does capture the most important
aspects of the model.  I find it useful as a high-level diagram,
hopefully you will too.
