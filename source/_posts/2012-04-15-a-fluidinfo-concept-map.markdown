It's been a long while since I posted.  A lot has happened!  A litte
more than a year ago I left [Canonical](http://canonical.com) and
joined [Fluidinfo](http://fluidinfo.com/).  Fluidinfo is a shared
openly-writable metadata storage platform, often referred to as a
social network for data.  There's a lot to say about Fluidinfo, much
of which is already discussed on the
[Fluidinfo blog](http://blogs.fluidinfo.com/fluidinfo/), and I plan to
write more about it in the future.  When I first got involved with
Fluidinfo I made a concept map to better understand the data model.
I've been meaning to publish it for ages, so here it is.
